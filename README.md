## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

JobSlayerML is a Streamlit-based application designed to make machine learning model selection and evaluation a breeze. It supports both regression and classification tasks, and it allows you to select from a range of machine learning models. It also provides options for performance evaluation, such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, F2 Score, or ROC AUC. Finally, it offers a comparative study of multiple models for quick analysis.
